My name is Frank DelPidio and I like to think of myself as a father, husband, and software engineer in that order.</p><p>I have been interested in Blockchain technology since I learned how to code in 2017. I first learned about Cardano in May 2021, and the more research I did, the more excited I became. Listening to Charles Hoskinson talk about the mission to build a global financial system that can service anyone in the world and the methodical research based approach to implement this vision, convinced me that I needed to take action to participate in this revolution.</p><p>My goal with this blog is to document my journey through the Cardano Frontier by writing technical articles to translate complex ideas into my own words, creating tutorials, and building developer tools. My hope is that sharing these posts will help another person on their journey.</p><p>If you would like to learn more, please reach out to me
