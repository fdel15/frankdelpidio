Learning how to learn is a fundamental skill that you need to develop as a software engineer. Like a lot of pioneers, learning Plutus also meant I needed to learn Haskell and functional programming at the same time. In this post I detail my learning strategy working through the [Plutus Pioneer Program](#) and [Learn You Haskell For the Greater Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).


## Plutus Pioneer Program

The Plutus Pioneer program is a 10 week program that has the following structure for each week:
    - Video Lecture
    - Code that is covered in the lecture
    - A Homework problem related to the code

The video lectures are between 1-2.5 hours long, and the P

These are the steps I would take for each week:
  - Watch the Video Lecture (2x speed)
  - How Ben Franklin would have learned to code
  - Rewatch the lecture and take notes
  - Do the homework
  - Repetition

## Learn Haskel For The Greater Good

- Read the chapter
- Experiement with Code
- Take Notes
